# Getting Started with SpaceX Launches
Welcome to the documentation for the SpaceX Launches application. This document provides an overview of the application, its features, and guidelines on how to set it up locally and use it.

This project was created with React and has been deployed to vercel.
For live demo, click [https://spacexlaunches-demo.vercel.app/](https://spacexlaunches-demo.vercel.app/) to view it in the browser.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

Node.js &
npm (Node Package Manager)

## Installation
- Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/rizwan-rizu/spacexlaunches.git`
- Navigate to the project folder: `cd spacexlaunches`
- Install dependencies: `npm install`
- Run the the appliation locally: `npm start`

## Technology Used
- Typescript
- React
- Material-UI (MUI)
- Mui-system for the styled-components
- Mui data grid.
- React-router-dom
- moment (open source data library)

## Design Choice
This application was designed and developed to appeal to users who prefer the dashboard layout with navigation on the left as well as those who prefer the Top Nav layout. (screenshots attached below)

We list all of the previous and upcoming launches on the main page/default route. In that view, too, I've given the user the option to choose between the cards and the data grid view, depending on their preference. (screenshots attached below)

I've also included links, an image list, and a YouTube video of the launch on the detail page of the rocket, launch pad, and launch.
